# Byte Relay

Your dev setup. At a glance.

A native macOS utility for discovering and managing local development servers,
AI agents and projects. Built with SwiftUI and AppKit. Free and open source.

## Requirements

The 1.0.0 release supports **macOS 26 or later on Apple Silicon**. The app UI is
currently German. Intel Macs, earlier macOS releases, remote processes and
container internals are outside the supported release scope.

## Features

- Discover local servers, ports and AI agents automatically.
- Group services by project folder and save favourites.
- Save launch commands, inspect their output and restart managed services.
- Pause, resume or stop processes with identity and ownership checks.
- Use a compact window, menu bar panel or optional notch panel.
- Share an HTTP server through a temporary Cloudflare Tunnel; copy its URL and
  stop sharing directly from the service row.
- Onboarding, keyboard access, Reduce Motion and Reduce Transparency support.
- Manually check for new releases from the app menu or Settings.

## Install

Download the **Byte-Relay.dmg** asset from a published GitHub release and drag
**Byte Relay.app** into Applications. Public release assets are Developer ID
signed, notarized and stapled. Do not bypass Gatekeeper to install a build.

Once the 1.0.0 release is published, the Byte Homebrew tap also provides:

```sh
brew install --cask byte-de/tap/byte-relay
```

## Privacy and sharing

Discovery reads your user's local process information and TCP listeners. Relay
has no account, telemetry, chat-content access or API-key access. Preferences,
project paths and launch commands are stored locally. Logs from app-launched
services are buffered in memory; external processes do not expose historical
stdout through Relay. Activity is session-local and bounded.

Sharing starts only after a user action and a first-use explanation. It exposes
the selected HTTP server through Cloudflare to **anyone with the link**. There is
no additional authentication in Relay 1.0.0. Stop sharing from the service row;
quitting Relay also stops its tunnels. The bundled supervisor stops the tunnel
if Relay exits unexpectedly. No existing cloudflared configuration is changed.
Do not share secrets, private source trees or unprotected admin interfaces.

[Cloudflare Quick Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/quick-tunnels/)
are intended for development, with temporary hostnames, no uptime guarantee,
a 200 in-flight request limit and no SSE support. Some dev servers require an
explicit allowed-host setting; configure the exact preview hostname rather than
disabling host checks globally.

Only the manual update check contacts GitHub. Download and installation remain
under your control; there is no automatic installer. The website's
[privacy notice](https://relay.byte.de/datenschutz/) describes hosting and these
optional network connections.

## Build and test

Requires a Swift 6 toolchain and macOS 26 SDK. Scripts use local toolchain
selection; they never change global Xcode settings.

```sh
Scripts/check.sh
Scripts/build-app.sh "/tmp/relay-local/Byte Relay.app"
```

Local builds use ad-hoc signing by default. A public release requires a Developer
ID identity and notarization credentials; see [Releasing](docs/RELEASING.md).
Generated products and caches stay outside the source directory. Override with
`RELAY_BUILD_DIR`, `RELAY_SDK`, `DEVELOPER_DIR` or `RELAY_CONFIGURATION` as needed.

For isolated manual testing, launch the executable with
`--state-directory /tmp/relay-test-state`. `--demo` uses sample data and disables
process actions and sharing. `--onboarding` opens the introduction. Debug-only
motion inspection uses `RELAY_MOTION_PREVIEW`; release builds ignore it.

## Data and migration

Preferences live in `~/Library/Application Support/Byte Relay/preferences.json`
with user-only permissions. The first launch can migrate settings from the
internal prototype's `DevScope` directory without removing its original file.
Existing Relay settings take precedence. Invalid or newer-format files are
preserved and saving is disabled until the problem is resolved. Back up the file
before repairing or removing it; restarting the app then retries loading.

## Architecture

`RelayCore` contains discovery, parsing, process identity validation, persistence,
tunnel lifecycle, release metadata validation and deterministic transition state.
`RelayApp` owns the SwiftUI UI and AppKit presentation coordination. `ProcessBridge`
provides narrow C access to macOS process APIs. `TunnelRunner` supervises only the
cloudflared process started by Relay. `RelayDiagnostics` provides fixture-based
integration checks. No privileged daemon or shell installer is used.

A listener is evidence of an open port, not an HTTP health check. Agent detection
is process-based and does not imply access to a task's internal progress.
